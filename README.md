•	I used different visuals to showcase the trends like Line and column chart, pie chart and ribbon charts.

•	I also used basic DAX function to get calculated column of Average Sales.

•	The dashboard provides as slicer which provides a filter for a Quarterly analysis.

•	It also provides another slicer which gives the liberty to have separate analysis based on different states. 

•	This helps in determining the target customers to increase the revenue. 

•	Visually evident that the Electronics is the hot selling category of the seller and it can further be optimized. 

•	Maharashtra seems to be a huge market, contributing around 40% to revenue, followed by Madhya Pradesh.
